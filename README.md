# Air-Canvas
This project demonstrates real-time color detection and drawing using OpenCV. The program captures video from the webcam, detects specific colors, and allows you to draw on a virtual canvas based on the detected colors.

Features
* Real-time video capture and processing
* HSV color space conversion for robust color detection
* Trackbars for dynamic adjustment of HSV thresholds
* Drawing on a virtual canvas using detected colors
* Color selection and clearing the canvas

Requirements
* Python 3.x
* OpenCV (cv2)
* NumPy

Code Explanation
* HSV Trackbars: Adjust the HSV range for color detection dynamically.
* Drawing on Canvas: Based on the detected color, draw on the virtual canvas.
* Color Buttons: Select different colors for drawing.
* Clear Button: Clear the entire canvas.
